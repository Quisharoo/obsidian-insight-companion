# Sample Outputs: New AI Tone

The following samples demonstrate how the updated AI prompt generates more observational, human, and lightly quirky summaries while preserving all structural requirements.

## Example 1: Date-Based Summary (Jan 1-31, 2024)

### OLD TONE (Before):
> **Generated by expert analyst specializing in extracting meaningful insights**
> 
> # Insight Summary
> 
> ## Key Themes
> - Communication strategy represents a crucial initiative with strategic alignment across multiple notes
> - Project management demonstrates clear focus on systematic approaches and deliverable optimization
> 
> ## Important People
> - Sarah Johnson: Project manager responsible for coordinating strategic initiatives
> 
> ## Action Items & Next Steps
> - Execute comprehensive communication plan implementation
> - Prioritize actionable insights for deliverable completion

### NEW TONE (After):
> **Generated by perceptive colleague helping make sense of scattered thinking**
> 
> # Insight Summary
> 
> ## Key Themes
> - Communication keeps popping up — might be on your mind, or maybe it's just in the air. Shows up in [[Team Standup Notes]] and [[Client Meeting Prep]]. Could be worth digging into.
> - Project planning stuff scattered across a few notes. Not necessarily a grand strategy, but there's definitely some organizing happening around deadlines in [[Q1 Planning]].
> 
> ## Important People
> - Sarah Johnson shows up a lot. Seems like a key person for project coordination, mentioned in [[Team Meeting]] and [[Budget Discussion]]. Probably someone to keep in the loop.
> 
> ## Action Items & Next Steps
> - That communication plan in [[Strategy Draft]] feels half-baked — might need another pass
> - Budget numbers in [[Q1 Planning]] look like they're waiting for approval or input
> - Client presentation mentioned in [[Meeting Notes]] but no clear next steps yet

## Example 2: Folder-Based Summary (Projects folder)

### OLD TONE (Before):
> **Comprehensive analysis of 15 notes from Projects folder**
> 
> # Insight Summary
> 
> ## Key Themes
> - Resource allocation represents the primary strategic focus across multiple project initiatives
> - Timeline management demonstrates systematic approach to deliverable coordination
> 
> ## Important People
> - Mike Chen: Technical lead responsible for implementation oversight
> - Lisa Park: Stakeholder liaison ensuring strategic alignment

### NEW TONE (After):
> **Looking through 15 notes from Projects folder**
> 
> # Insight Summary
> 
> ## Key Themes
> - Resource stuff keeps coming up — not surprising for a projects folder, but there's some real tension around who's available when. [[Resource Planning]] and [[Team Capacity]] both flag this.
> - Deadlines are... flexible. Multiple notes mention shifting timelines, which could mean scope creep or just reality hitting the plan. Worth keeping an eye on.
> - Integration work shows up in [[API Design]] and [[System Architecture]] — seems like a bigger piece than originally scoped.
> 
> ## Important People
> - Mike Chen appears in most of the technical notes. Sounds like he's carrying a lot of the implementation load. Mentioned concerns about bandwidth in [[Team Check-in]].
> - Lisa Park is the external-facing person. Client relationship management falls to her, based on [[Stakeholder Updates]] and [[Client Feedback]].
> 
> ## Action Items & Next Steps
> - Resource conflict between [[Project Alpha]] and [[Project Beta]] needs sorting out — they're competing for the same people
> - That API integration in [[Technical Specs]] looks like it's going to be more work than planned
> - Client demo scheduled but no clear prep plan in [[Demo Planning]]
> 
> ## Notes Referenced
> - 15 notes covering project planning, technical specs, team coordination, and client management
> - Mix of recent updates and older planning documents
> - Several notes flagged resource constraints and timeline concerns

## Key Differences in New Tone:

✅ **Uses observational language**: "keeps coming up", "seems like", "might be"
✅ **More human and conversational**: "Not surprisingly", "reality hitting the plan"
✅ **Avoids corporate buzzwords**: No "strategic alignment", "comprehensive analysis", "crucial initiatives"
✅ **Shows uncertainty appropriately**: "Could be worth digging into", "Worth keeping an eye on"
✅ **Maintains technical requirements**: Proper [[Note Title]] links, clean Markdown, required sections
✅ **Preserves structure**: All four required sections present and properly formatted
✅ **Same for both modes**: Both folder-based and date-based use identical tone and approach
