- **jsdom** environment for DOM testing

### Mocking
- **Obsidian API** fully mocked in `test-vite-react/mocks/obsidian.ts`
- **Console methods** mocked to prevent noise in test output
- **File system operations** mocked where appropriate

### Coverage
- **62 total tests** across all features
- **100% pass rate**
- **Comprehensive coverage** of all completed plugin features

## Running Tests

```bash
